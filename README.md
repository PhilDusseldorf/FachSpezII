# Ye old CD-Shop

## Getting Started

This project is a retro cd shop. I am creating a desktop app to show the shop's catalogue and allow to make purchases from this catalogue.

To implement functionalities I use simple JAVA and the Swift-API. For a future project I will look into React to make a webshop App. But for now I stick to JAVA as I am still learning for the OCA exam.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `preparation`: the folder for project preperation like mockups or diagrams
- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies like sqlite

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.
